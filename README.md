## Overview 
NeuroCurve builds live risk curves which predict risk of Alzheimer's by simulating how improvements in human activities can influence risk. It combines a Neural Network with visualization tools to help interpret risk trajectories for individual patients.

---

## Key Features
- **Age-Risk Simulation**: Modify patient age, diet quality, sleep quality, exercice, and/or BMI scores to predict risk.
- **Easy-to-Use**: Plug in your trained model and patient features to visualize risk over time.
- **Visualization**: Clear plots drawing predicted risk progression.
