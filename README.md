## Overview
NeuroCurve builds dynamic risk curves for neurological conditions (e.g., Alzheimerâ€™s) by simulating how risk evolves across age and functional assessment scores. It combines supervised learning (e.g., Random Forests) with visualization tools to help interpret risk trajectories for individual patients.

---

## Key Features
- **Age-Risk Simulation**: Modify patient age and optionally FunctionalAssessment scores to predict risk.
- **Flexible Feature Support**: Any feature (e.g., BMI, ADL, FunctionalAssessment).
- **Easy-to-Use API**: Plug in your trained `model` and patient features to visualize risk over time.
- **Visualization**: Clear plots showing predicted risk progression.
