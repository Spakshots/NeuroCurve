NeuroCurve

1. Problem Domain 
    -“Navigating risk before memory fades.”
Rather than just predicting Alzheimer's, this tool maps a patient’s cognitive health trajectory over time. 
It identifies high-risk profiles based on lifestyle, health history, and cognitive markers,
 offering visual insights into how individual factors (like BMI, sleep, or blood pressure) bend the curve toward cognitive decline.
    - age is the proxy for time
    - this could profile individual's risks over time, rather than just an age of predicted diagnosis
    - we can also create trajectories which diverge at the patient's current age, so we could plot one graph which is their current risk as they cotinue aging,
     and another graph lets say which graphs their risk as they age if they were to stop smoking (for example)
    - so users could see their risk of alzheimers over time, click off boxes that represent, if they stopped smoking, got better sleep etc. and then we
     could have the model demonstrate their decline in risk vs if they were to change their habits
