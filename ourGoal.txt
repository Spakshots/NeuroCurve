1. Problem Domain 
    -“Navigating risk before memory fades.”
Rather than just predicting Alzheimer's, this tool maps a patient’s cognitive health trajectory over time. 
It identifies high-risk profiles based on lifestyle, health history, and cognitive markers,
 offering visual insights into how individual factors (like BMI, sleep, or blood pressure) bend the curve toward cognitive decline.
    - age is the proxy for time
    - this could profile individual's risks over time, rather than just an age of predicted diagnosis
